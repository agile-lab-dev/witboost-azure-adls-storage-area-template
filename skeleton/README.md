## Overview

Use this component to create an ADLSgen2 for internal storage of a Data Product.

### What's a Storage Area?

A Storage Area is what the components of a Data Product use to persist data that is created or used by the various Workloads or served by Output Ports.

### ADLSgen2 Storage Area Template

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is a set of capabilities dedicated to big data analytics, built on Azure Blob Storage. Data Lake Storage Gen2 converges the capabilities of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 with Azure Blob Storage.

For example, Data Lake Storage Gen2 provides file system semantics, file-level security, and scale. Because these capabilities are built on Blob storage, you also get low-cost, tiered storage, with high availability/disaster recovery capabilities.

Data Lake Storage Gen2 makes Azure Storage the foundation for building enterprise data lakes on Azure. Designed from the start to service multiple petabytes of information while sustaining hundreds of gigabits of throughput, Data Lake Storage Gen2 allows you to easily manage massive amounts of data.

Data Lake Storage Gen2 includes the following capabilities:

- Hadoop-compatible access
- Hierarchical directory structure
- Optimized cost and performance
- Finer grain security model
- Massive scalability
